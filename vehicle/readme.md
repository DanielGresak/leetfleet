# Smart-Vehicle (Exposed-Thing)

Author: Jörg Striebel

This TypeScript code implements the base of our smart vehicle thing, containing the logic of the so-called Exposed-Thing. Unlike in our first attempt (see directory “old_scripts”) were we implemented an Exposed-Thing and a Consumed-Thing directly in JavaScript, the approach of using TypeScript provides not only type safety but more importantly allows the separation of source code and build directories. Moreover, by using node-wot merely as a npm dependency enables us to only install the dependencies required for this specific use case. For instance, in our case we have only installed the HTTP binding while omitting all other dependencies such as CoAP, MQTT, etc.

This smart vehicle provides the following so-called Property Affordances, Action Affordances, and Event Affordances:

Properties:
-	propFleetId
-	propVehicleId
-	propOilLevel
-	propTyrePressure
-	propTotalMileage
-	propServiceDistance
-	propDoorStatus
-	propMaintenanceNeeded
Actions:
-	actionLockDoor
-	actionUnlockDoor
Events:
-	eventLowOnOil
-	eventLowTyrePressure
-	eventMaintenanceNeeded

All these affordances are defined in the Thing Description (TD) which is embedded in this vehicle. To maintain reusability, certain properties can be injected via the constructor from the starting point (index.js) which can be seen as the index.html of websites.
Depending on the property, they may possess all or only a subset of the following attributes [readable, writable, observable]. 

For demonstration purposes, the smart-vehicle Exposed-Thing implementation also contains an emulation which emulates the mileage increase, the oil consumption, and the tyre pressure loss over time. Whenever a critical threshold is reached, the emulation then triggers the events accordingly. 

## Code structure:

-	**index.js**:  The index.js can be seen the starting point of the Exposed-Thing, similarly to the index.html of websites. This is common practice for npm packages.
-	**src**: This directory contains the logic of the Exposed-Thing in TypeScript
-	**dist**: This directory contains the trans-compiled logic of the Exposed-Thing in JavaScript source format, which is then invoked by the index.js.
-	**package.json**: Contains all dependencies for the npm project.


## Useful commands at a glance:
- npm run clean
- npm install
- npm run build
- npm run buildAll
- npm run start

## Retrieving the Thing Description
GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle
 
It returns the Thing Description (TD) in JSON, describing all Affordances Interactions, metadata, etc. of the Thing.
Note that the endpoint "smart-vehicle" is defined in the TD as the title.

## Properties

### Property: allAvailableResources
GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/allAvailableResources

This property can be used to retrieve all availabe resources. For now, we have only two sensor values: "oilLevel" and "tyrePressure".
It returns a JSON object containing all available resources. 

### Property: availableResourceLevel
The "availableResourceLevel" property enables to read and write an indivudal resource. For example, reading/writing the "tyrePressure" property.


**Example - writing the a new value for "tyrePressure":**

PUT http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/availableResourceLevel?id=tyrePressure

Payload format: JSON, datatype: Integer

After updating the values successfully, the exposed thing responds with "204 No Content".


**Example - reading the value for "tyrePressure":**

GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/availableResourceLevel?id=tyrePressure


### Property: totalMileage

The property "totalMileage" is read-only, and is internally increased using a random function every time the property is being read.

GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/totalMileage


### Property: nextServiceMileage

The "nextServiceMileage" property is by default set to 30,000 km. This property is read-/writeable. 
Currently it is decreased by the same amount the "totalMileage" is increased.
However, this emulation might be improved and enhanced in the future...

GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/nextServiceMileage

PUT http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/nextServiceMileage

The payload is JSON and the value is an integer. It also responds with "204 No Content" on success.


### Property: doorStatus

The "doorStatus" property indicates whether the door is "LOCKED" or "UNLOCKED" and returns the status as a string.

GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/doorStatus


### Property: maintenanceNeeded

The "maintencanceNedded" property is set TRUE when the property "nextServiceMileage" is lower than 500 km.
This property is read-/writeable and observable.

GET http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/maintenanceNeeded

PUT http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/properties/maintenanceNeeded

The payload is JSON and the value is an boolean. It also responds with "204 No Content" on success.


## Actions

### Action: lockDoor

The action "lockDoor" locks the vehicle door and returns the status "LOCKED" along with "200 OK" on success.

POST http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/actions/lockDoor


### Action: unLockDoor

The action "unlockDoor" unlocks the vehicle door and returns the status "UNLOCKED" along with "200 OK" on success.

POST http://localhost:8080/smart-vehicle/actions/unLockDoor

# Docker

Creating and running a container and defining a name for it, e.g. "vehicle1"

docker run -d --name vehicle1 leetfleet/vehicle
