                                    The WoT-Bridge
********************************************************************************************
Author: Jörg Striebel & Ian Foster

The WoT-Hive, which is an implementation of a W3C Web of Things directory, forms the backbone
of our bridge between the Web of Things world and the backend AKKA part. It allows for
Exposed-Things to register themselves with this directory and for the bridge to retrieve the
Thing Descriptions (TD) of these Exposed-Things either individually or as a list of TDs.
The WoT-Hive API offers CRUD methods to modify its configuration, register Exposed-Things,
retrieve individual or the entire list of registered TDs, and to subscribe to so-called
Server-Sent-Events (SSE). The SSE would allow to notify a client which has subscribed to
specific events, whenever one of these events is triggered. For instance, a client that has
registered itself for a “thing created” event, would be notified every time a new
Exposed-Things has been registered. So far, that is the theory.

However, in practise it turned out that the SSE API had not been fully functional at the
time of testing it end of November 2022. This WoT-Hive project was launched at a university
in Madrid and released in early 2022. Judging by the commit history this project still seemed
to be in progress, potentially not yet fully implemented but certainly lacking comprehensive
documentation. So, when trying to subscribe to the “created” event, the server would return
with a HTTP 404 error, indicating that unlike outlined in the description of the WoT-Hive API,
this feature may had not been implemented yet. The code for the SSE client implementation
can be found commented out at the end of this file.

Consequently, we had to come up with a workaround. Instead of having the bridge notified
through Server-Sent-Events every time a new Exposed-Thing is registered, the bridge is now
sending requests to the server at regular intervals (polling) for retrieving the entire
list of registered TDs. In theory it would be possible to define an expiry date for
registered TDs. However, since we are polling the directory now actively, we need to ensure
that only currently Exposed-Things are registered with the directory as only those can be
consumed by its counterpart called “Consumed-Thing”.

To realise this, the functionality of the bridge can be summarised as follows:
-	Fetching a list of TDs from the WoT-Hive directory at regular intervals
    (currently every 10 sec)
-	Checking the fetched cache for relevant TD entries
        o	Keeping track of outdated TDs to be deleted
        o	Keeping track of current TDs to be consumed
        o	Keeping track of TDs that have already be consumed
-	Cleaning up the WoT-Hive directory by deleting outdated TDs. Therefore, keeping the
    amount of data that must be exchanged to a minimum
-	Creating a so-called “Consumed-Thing”
    o	For each TD to be consumed a so-called “Servient” is instantiated
    o	For each TD to be consumed a HTTP server with its individual port is being created
    o	A client-factory and the HTTP server is than added to the servient
-	Finally, the servient spins up a Consumed-Thing for each TD
